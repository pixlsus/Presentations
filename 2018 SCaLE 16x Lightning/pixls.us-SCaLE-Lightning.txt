1. Introduction
[Green Tiger Beetle?]
[Bare slide (clean white) from LGM2016?]
"Building a Freedom Based Photography Community"
I'm Pat David - member of the GIMP team and founder of PIXLS.US

2. Why did I start PIXLS.US?
Two main reasons - better tutorials/showcase and community (synthesis)
I'm a member of the GIMP team, and frustrated by the quality of tutorials and results.
I was friends with many of the projects already (G'MIC, darktable, rawtherapee, more).

3. (Bad GIMP examples?)
[Bad GIMP slide from LGM 2016?]
    * Poor quality
    * Cheap monetization (multiple click-thru pages)
    * Un-original content

4. Needed a community based on a topic (photography), not a specific software
Other communitites are often software-focused.
Problem is - one software may work for many different types of use (painters vs. photogs vs. animators vs. comics)
Commercial communities include Free Software as an afterthought sub-forum.


--- What was the answer? ---

5. Mission Statement!
[Green Tiger Beetle?]
Put photography with Free Software front-and-center.
Combine resources into one location - subject matter experts and other resources (raw.pixls.us)

6. Bring together multiple projects based on *photography*
(Project Logos/names?)
darktable, RawTherapee, GIMP, G'MIC, etc.

7. Side effect - smaller/new projects have a home also
[Fishes/Under the sea?]
(That they might not have as much otherwise - same footing?)
    * Rapid Photo Downloader
    * HDRMerge
    * Filmulator
    * PhotoFlow

--- What do we have so far? ---

8. Articles + Blog slide
