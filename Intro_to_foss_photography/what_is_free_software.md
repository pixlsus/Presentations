## What is Free Software?

. . .

The four software freedoms:

> - Run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
> - Study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1).
> - Redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor (freedom 2).
> - Distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3).
