PIXLS.US [pronounced like "pixels dot us"] is a photographic community brought together by Free Software.

The goal of the community is:
"To provide tutorials, workflows, and a showcase for high-quality photography using Free Software"

The community has had an amazing year!
The forums have seen over 3.1M pageviews and has grown to over 1,350 users.

We have started raw.pixls.us to store and make available raw files for any project to use for testing or other purposes.
This is to replace the old rawsamples.ch website that is no longer functioning.
To date we have 693 raw sample files from 477 different cameras.
Please check the site and donate raw samples to help!

Traffic has grown steadily since we started and we have an active and engaged community.

We are hoping to help Free Software photography projects with any infrastructure support they may need.
