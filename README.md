## Logos
Relevant [PIXLS.US logo/image assets][Logos].
These are `.svg` files - the default slate blue is the current background to the logo on the site, and is: `#778899`.  The background can also be set to white `#FFFFFF` as appropriate for the medium.

The foreground color for the logo/text is _not_ black.  It's a dark gray: `#323232` RGB(50,50,50).

### The League of Movable Type
[The League of Movable Type][lmt] ([github](https://github.com/theleagueof)) has various font faces of note that have been used in the past, including:

* [League Gothic][] ([github](https://github.com/theleagueof/league-gothic))
* [Ostrich Sans][] ([github](https://github.com/theleagueof/ostrich-sans))
* [Raleway][] ([github](https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway))

The larger, bolder type is [League Gothic][] and the lighter sans-serif font is often [Ostrich Sans][]. Both of these are used in the LGM2015 State of the Libre Graphics presentation slides.
